Engage in my world of algorithmic design, where I've applied the Knight's Tour Problem to a real-life scenario. Witness the magic through a captivating Blender animation project, showcasing the synergy between design and algorithmic analysis. 
What is knight Tour ?

The Knight's Tour is a classic chess problem where the objective is to find a sequence of moves for a knight that visits each square on the chessboard exactly once. The knight moves in an "L" shape—two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that. The challenge is to determine if there is a closed knight's tour (ending at the starting position) on an n×n chessboard, and if so, to find such a tour. This problem has practical applications in algorithm design, optimization, and graph theory.
